    <p>Happy birthday my love, you're now a big womanüòå, but
    you're still my babygirl. As you turn a new age today, I want
    you to take your time and reflect on how far you've come
    especially your wins and accomplishments. I've watched you progress from a girl with plans and goals
    to a woman with a roadmap to achieving those goals and maintaining discipline while doing so.
    And as you do so as you grow older, God will help you maintain your vision and streak with whatever
    things you hope to achieve.
    When this year began, I assured and promised you that there would be a noticable change in how I handled your
    wants and desires. I decided to clear your wishlist to the best of my ability for your birthday.

        <h2>1: iPad 10th Gen Hot-pink case with Apple pencil slot</h2>
        <p>I looked high and low for this, because I know you particularly want it in that color to match the 
          aesthetic. I only found for phones so I paid Bodman to search and obtain from one of their suppliers
          via Amazon. (It's actually more of transparent and hotpinküôÇ‚Äç‚ÜîÔ∏è; what you're seeing below is what I was 
          forwarded by Bodman from their supplier.)

        <h2>2: Outlash Brand's Astra Slides In Black</h2>
        <p>Going through their catalouge, I immediately understood why you love this brand (I think you've bought from 
          them before). I got something for you that I'm sure you'd love. Apparently Outlash sells according to their 
          branches (Abuja and Lagos). What you'll be receiving is from the Abuja branch since Lagos was sold out. I've
          paid and delagated someone to handle logisitcs to your school.

        <h2>3: Coach Mollie Tote bag with Cherry Print & Charm </h2>
        <p>You have repeatedly emphasized on how much you'd love to own this bag. If my princess wants something, then
          my princess will get it. The lady that runs the store that retails informed me that her supplier has closed 
          until February before they resume. Regardless, I paid for the bag, charm and express shipping because there 
          shall be no excuse.

        <h2>4: Berbie Beauty's Brianna Set Activewear </h2>
        <p>Following up with your gym goals for this year and you really wanting activewear from this brand, I got it 
          for you. Most of their pieces were sold out initially with the rest being things you wouldn't be able to 
          even wear/use in school. Got in contact with their customer care then their sales rep who assured me there 
          would soon be a restock. And there was. This set is something I know you'll love judging from the other 
          activewear you have.

      <p>Everything I've listed above will be on your way to you from within now till the end of February, especially 
        considering that businesses are just opening shop for the year(restocking) and one or two of them are being 
        shipped in. The pictures I've added is to reassure you that they will definitely come through and you shouldn't
        fret but be happily expectant. All this doesn't mean there isn't something coming your way today; there is - 
        something sweet, cute and consumable. I'll be busy today handling studio work for matriculation so make sure to
        enjoy your day with your friends.
        I love you very very muchüíû
